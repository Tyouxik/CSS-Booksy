Welcome to my Booksy CSS Challenge !

Scrolling through Dribbble, I came across this nice, minimalist design by Adarsh Goldar, called Booksy: https://dribbble.com/shots/14240831-Booksy-Online-Book-Shop

The biggest challenge is to make the page responsive, as the design is for a webpage, I started on a Desktop first approach which made it hard to make the page responsive for tablet and phone.

Starting with a freestyle naming of my classes, I modified all my HTML/CSS naming to match the BEM methodology. Suddenly, my code became clearer, and easier to work with.

I hope you like this page :)
